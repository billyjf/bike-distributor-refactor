I've taken this project and ensured:

	* Unit tests always pass per re-factor before each commit.
	* Code duplication is kept to a minimum for ease of readability and maintenance for the next engineer.

What's been tested:

	* More bikes at new prices: Felt F1 x 5 at 20% off and Cervelo S5 Dura-Ace x 5 at 20% off.
	* Additional receipt formats: PDF was added

The code can easily support different discount codes and percentages in the future with minimal changes necessary.
